# misodope_react_boilerplate

## A simple React and Express boilerplate
This boilerplate was created for the intent to rapidly prototype React apps. 

### Installation
Download or clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER/misodope_react_boilerplate.git
```

Install the necessary modules
```
npm install
```

### Starting it up
To begin we bootup our server using Nodemon. Nodemon watches for your code changes and will automatically restart the node application whenever a change occurs.
```
npm run server-dev
```

Then we need to create our bundle.js using webpack. We do this by running the following command:
```
npm run react-dev
```

### Developing
Once everything is up and running you can begin your development. As you save your code changes webpack and nodemon will be watching for your code changes and will automatically update.
You can visibily see this happening inside terminal/bash. Once you see the automatic updates complete, simply refresh your page.
